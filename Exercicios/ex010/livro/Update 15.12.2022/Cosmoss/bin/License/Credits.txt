Dark Byte
---------------
- Speedhack:
CoSMOS uses the same calculation method in its speedhack function.
- Script Engine:
CoSMOS uses a very close syntax for script injection merely to provide interoperability and compatibility with Dark Byte's open source cheat tables.
- VEH Debugger:
The core debugger is completely self written in C# but Dark Byte's source code was a great help with that. Additionally CoSMOS uses the same inter-process communication of Dark Byte's VEH.
